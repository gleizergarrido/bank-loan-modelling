## Bank personal loan

### About this project

To my first project here I got it a dataset from the [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahmadrafiee/bank-personal-loan/data) one dataset which is from Thera Bank. The managers want to explore possibilities to converting liability curstomers to personal loan customers. A campaign that the bank ran last year for liability customers showed a healthy conversion rate of over 9% success. This has encouraged the retail marketing department to devise campaigns with better target marketing to increase the success ratio with minimal budget.

One of the biggest questions of loans it is amplifie your client wallet keeping a manageble level of default (what is invetable to happens), in those questions, organizations keeping studies that search for select the 'best' clients or that ones with less propation to default.
